This is a simple guessing game which generates an integer between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess what integer it generated.

If the guessed integer is too low, the game will say so. 
If the guess is too high, the game will say so. 
If the guess is not an integer, the game will complain.
When the correct integer is guessed the game will print out the number of tries it took and terminate.


This version also returns the last three guesses you made, including the guesses involving obcene phrases.
